# Tic-tac-toe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bernardosulzbach/tic-tac-toe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bernardosulzbach/tic-tac-toe)

This repository contains AI implementations for the popular paper-and-pencil
game known as Tic-tac-toe. There is also a GUI-based game that allows the user
to play against the computer. [There is also a blog post about this project](http://www.bernardosulzbach.com/tic-tac-toe-using-racket/).

The badge on this section presents the build and test status of the master
branch.

# Racket Code

You will need, as you may assume, a Racket distribution in order to run the
Racket program. The algorithm used is a simple minimax implementation.

Running the interactive game will allow you to play against the computer.

This should be as simple as

```bash
$ racket game.rkt
```
